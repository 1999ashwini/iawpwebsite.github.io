      <p>Aside from the very mercenary I’m assuming you want to show appreciation without sounding clueless. Hell maybe I sound clueless but I like,

Great lighting, capture, composition, contrast, juxtaposition, creativity, use of depth of field. Great could of course be spectacular, unique, original, fantastic…whatever comes to mind first really is usually the most sincere.  It is totally subjective. There is usually something that jumps out first to your eye and just go with it. Don’t over analyze just shoot with what you like. It’s totally subjective and no right or wrong. Sometimes the technical makes an impression sometimes the artistic and of course sometimes both.</p>

                    <p>The brain of the Gas Leak Detector is the Arduino Uno which controls the entire function of the circuit and the MQ-2 sensor is used to sense the leakage of gas. 
As we know the problems occurs in the day to day life at home related to the LPG gas, to solve such problems we design the automatic LPG gas booking and leakage detection system.</p>
<p>• Booking gas process is automatically.</p>
<p>• We can detect gas leakage instantly.</p>
<p>• LPG leakage is detected through the sensor.</p>
<p>• To real time gas monitoring system.</p>
<p>• To provide security for home, hotels, industries etc.</p>

Regular interaction with different people can help in identifying the things happening around the world or within the society.
